## Setup

1. Make sure the latest version of Rust environment is installed on your system
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pleveris/tictactoe-game.git
   ```
3.
   ```sh
   cd tictactoe-game
   ```
4.
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```
5. Enjoy! :-)

## Future todos
- [ ] Replace game board representation from number input (1-9) to column-letter input (collumns A to C, numbers 1 to 3 as rows for each column) to make game board more realistic;
- [ ] Add more interaction with sounds;
- [ ] Add some automated tests not only to test game functions, but also in order to learn how they are handled by Rust itself;
- [ ] Create a multiplayer, web-based realtime game (lack of knowledge in Russt prevents from doing itt right now).
